	{
		"questions":["What are the possible restricted stock award types that I may receive?"],
		"answer":"Restricted Stock Shares (RSS)Restricted Stock Shares are awards which entitle the recipient to ownership rights in the company's stock. These rights are generally subject to sale restrictions and/or risk of forfeiture until a specific vesting date in the future. Typically, awards vest in one of two ways: (1) full vesting on a specific date in the future or (2) incremental vesting over several specific dates in the future. During the restricted period the recipient may have voting rights and the right to dividends paid on the restricted shares (please refer to your company's plan document for specifics). Dividends may be paid to you in cash or may be reinvested in additional restricted shares. Once vested, the Restricted Stock Shares are usually no longer subject to restriction. (Note: The definition of RSS may vary depending on the specific terms of each plan. Please refer to your company's plan documents for specifics.)Restricted Stock Units (RSU)Restricted Stock units are awards given to you in units instead of actual shares. Each unit awarded generally represents the value of one share of stock. Generally, an award of Restricted Stock Units entitles the recipient to stock (equal to the number of units awarded) upon vest. Recipients of Restricted Stock Units usually have no ownership or voting rights until vest although the company may chose to pay the recipient a dividend equivalent. Additionally, units are usually subject to risk of forfeiture until a specific date in the future. Typically, units will vest in one of two ways: (1) full vesting on a specific date in the future or (2) incremental vesting over several specific dates in the future. Under most RSU plans, once a vesting occurs, shares equivalent to the underlying Restricted Stock Units are delivered to the recipient. (Note: Your company may pay you the cash equivalent of your restricted stock units at vest instead of giving you shares; please refer to your company's plan documents to determine if this is applicable to you.)Performance Stock Shares (PSS)Performance Stock Shares are awards which entitle the recipient to ownership rights in the company's stock. These rights are generally subject to sale restrictions and/or risk of forfeiture until a specific performance measurement is satisfied. Performance measurements will vary based on the plan under which they were granted. Please consult your company's plan documents for specifics on performance measurements. Typically, awards vest in one of two ways: (1) full vesting on or after a specific performance measurement date or (2) incremental vesting over several specific performance measurement dates. During the restricted period the recipient may have voting rights and the right to dividends paid on the restricted shares (please refer to your company's plan document for specifics). Dividends may be paid to you in cash or may be reinvested in additional performance shares. Once vested, the restricted shares are usually no longer subject to restriction.Performance Share Units (PSU)Performance Share Units are awards granted in units instead of actual shares. Each unit awarded generally represents the value of one share of stock. Generally, an award of Performance Share Units entitles the recipient to stock upon vest. (Note: Your company may pay you the cash equivalent of your Performance Share Units at vest instead of giving you shares; please reference your company's plan documents to determine if this is applicable to you.) Recipients of Performance Share Units usually have no ownership or voting rights until vest although the company may choose to pay the recipient a dividend equivalent. Additionally, Performance Share Units are usually subject to risk of forfeiture until a specific performance measurement is satisfied. Typically, Performance Share Units will vest in one of two ways: (1) full vesting on or after a specific performance measurement date or (2) incremental vesting over several specific performance measurement dates. Under most Performance Share Unit plans, once a vesting occurs, shares equivalent to the underlying units are generally delivered to the recipient.Deferred Stock Shares (DSS)The definition of Deferred Stock Shares may vary depending on the specific terms of each plan. Please refer to your company's plan documents for specifics.Deferred Stock Units (DSU)The definition of Deferred Stock Units may vary depending on the specific terms of each plan. Please refer to your company's plan documents for specifics.Phantom Stock Awards (PSA)A Phantom Stock Award is a type of incentive award in which the recipient is not issued actual shares of stock on the award date but receives a credit equal to a certain number of hypothetical per shares. The payout on a Phantom Stock Award at vest is generally the difference between the hypothetical share value at award and the hypothetical value at vest. Payout may be settled in cash or stock. Phantom Stock Award vestings may be time-based or performance based. Performance criteria will vary. Please refer to your company's specific plan details."
	},
	{
		"questions":["What is the difference between restricted stock and performance stock?"],
		"answer":"Restricted Stock Shares are issued but cannot be sold until they vest, usually after a specified length of employment or sometimes, after performance goals have been met. Performance Stock Shares are usually part of a long-term performance plan, and the payout is earned by meeting targets and/or goals. When in the form of performance stock, the payment may be in stock or in cash and may have other design features."

		"questions":["What does vesting mean?"],

	},
	{
		"questions":["My restricted stock will be released at vesting. What does that mean?"],
		"answer":"Releasing restricted stock is the process by which your company transfers shares to you when your restricted stock vests. After the vesting occurs and any applicable withholding taxes are paid, your shares are released."
	},
	{
		"questions":["What happens once my restricted awards/units vest?"],

	},
	{
		"questions":["What is a tax payment election, and why may I need to make an election before my restricted stock vests?"],
		"answer":"The tax payment election allows you to choose the method by which you may pay withholding taxes on the stock or units that vest (unless your plan automatically prescribes the tax payment method). The specifics depend on each company's plan, policy, and practice."
	},
	{
		"questions":["What is a deferral election?"],
		"answer":"For deferred vesting, a deferral election allows you to defer the delivery of the shares from vest date until another date in the future. If your company's plan, policy, and practice allows for deferrals, and you choose to defer receipt of your shares, tax consequences may also be delayed to the date of actual share delivery. This election needs to be made in advance (based upon rules specified by your company).Deferral Choices: Until Next Vest,Retirement,Death, Termination, Until a Specific Period"
	},
	{
		"questions":["Do I get dividends with restricted stock units (RSU)? How are these dividends taxed?"],
		"answer":"When a company pays dividends on outstanding shares of stock, it may pay dividend equivalents on Restricted Stock Units. Dividend equivalent payments may either be paid in cash or may be reinvested in additional units. Generally, if reinvested in additional units, these additional units will usually follow the same vesting schedule as the original Restricted Stock Unit award. Your company will decide whether you have a right to dividend equivalents and how they will be treated. Your company will also decide how fractional shares that result from the reinvestment of a dividend equivalent are handled. Dividends paid in cash are always taxable upon receipt. A dividend paid in the form of additional units will normally be taxable at the time the units vest, which in most cases is the same time as the Restricted Stock Unit to which the dividend is attributable. The dollar value of the dividend is reported as additional compensation on your Form W-2 (unless a deferral election is allowed and made)."
	},
	{
		"questions":["How does the U.S. taxation of Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units differ?"],
		"answer":"With Restricted Stock Shares, you are usually taxed at vest. However, if you choose to make what is commonly referred to as a Section 83(b) Election, you will pay tax when you are awarded the restricted stock, but not when it vests. You will report capital gain or loss when you eventually sell the stock. With Restricted Stock Units you are taxed at vest unless you previously made a deferral election. The type of deferral election will dictate the tax consequences. With Restricted Stock Units, the delivery of shares usually occurs at vesting unless a deferral election is made. If a deferral occurs, you may be taxed at the end of the deferral period rather than at vest. If the shares from a Restricted Stock Award never vest because you leave the company, you cannot recover any taxes that you paid with the 83(b) election."
	},
	{
		"questions":["How is restricted stock taxed with the U.S.?", "How is restricted stock taxed with the US?", "How is restricted stock taxed with the USA?", "How is restricted stock taxed with the United States"],
		"answer":"Generally, you pay tax at the time the award vests. Your taxable income is usually the value of the stock and minus any amount paid for the stock (generally, $0). The value of the stock at vest is determined by your company's plan documents.Example: You are awarded 1,000 shares of restricted stock that vest 100% three years after the award date. The FMV on award date was $10, the value of the stock in year three at vest is $20. Your ordinary income at vest equals $20,000 (1,000 shares multiplied by $20). If you sell all 1,000 shares of stock two years after vest, when the price is at $30, you capital gain would be $10,000 ($30 minus $20, multiplied by 1,000).Alternatively, you may be able to make a Section 83(b) Election with the IRS within 30 days of the award. You will then pay taxes on the value of the stock at award, which will start your capital gains holding period. If the shares never vest because you leave the company, you cannot recover any taxes that you paid with the 83(b) Election.Scenario 1: Using the example above, you make a timely 83(b) Election at award. You will then pay taxes on ordinary income of $10,000 ($10 fair market value at award multiplied by 1,000 shares). You will pay no additional taxes at the time of the vest. However, if you sell two years after vest at $30 per share, your capital gain will be $20,000 ($30 minus $10, multiplied by 1,000 shares).Scenario 2: Using the example above, you make a timely 83(b) Election at award. You then pay taxes on ordinary income of $10,000 ($10 fair market value at award multiplied by 1,000 shares). One year later, you terminate your employment with the company and forfeit your shares. In this scenario, you will have paid tax on $10,000 of ordinary income, yet you will receive no shares and you may not reclaim the taxes from the Internal Revenue Service."
	},
	{
		"questions":["Is there tax withholding on restricted stock?"],
		"answer":"Generally, there is withholding tax on restricted stock at vest. The receipt of restricted stock will result in ordinary income to you either when it vests or at award date if you properly filed a Section 83(b) election. The withholding treatment is similar to that of any other form of compensation. Withholding taxes (that will appear on your W-2) include:Federal income taxSocial Security (up to the maximum) and MedicareState and Local taxes, when applicable"
	},
	{
		"questions":["What is included in my W-2 in connection with a restricted stock award?"],
		"answer":"The award of restricted stock will result in ordinary income to you. This occurs either at the time the award vests or when an 83(b) election is made (for unvested shares within 30 days of the award). Your compensation is the stock price at vesting multiplied by the number of shares vested. (If an 83(b) election was made at the time the restricted stock was awarded, your compensation income is the fair market value of the stock price at award multiplied by the total shares granted.) The income will be reported on Form W-2 as follows:Box 1: wages, tips, and other compensation ,Box 3: Social Security wages up to the income ceiling, Box 5: Medicare, Box 16: state wages (if applicable), Box 18: local wages (if applicable), The amount withheld in connection with your restricted stock is included, when appropriate, in Boxes 2, 4, 6, 17, and 19."
	},
	{
		"questions":["Can I make a Section 83(b) election for an award of restricted stock units (RSUs)?"],
		"answer":"Most experts say that you cannot: there is no distribution of property (i.e., shares) at the time of the RSU award, as there is with restricted stock. Without the election, you are taxed at the time the shares are distributed, usually at vesting (unless a deferral election is available and is made)."

		"answer":"The Expiration Date is the date that any outstanding options are forfeited if they have not previously been exercised or terminated early in accordance with the terms and conditions of your company’s plans (e.g., in connection with your termination of employment). Since all plans can treat this expiration date and the timing of the grant expiration differently, refer to your company's plan documents for related details regarding your plan. It is important to note the last day on which you can exercise your option may be a different day than what is being displayed as your expiration date. Monitor your expiration date and be aware of when the market is open. If the option is set to expire on a day that the market is closed, you need to act when the market is open before your plan defined expiration date. Generic Example: An employee receives a grant of 100 options on January 5, 2008. The stock option plan states that the options will expire ten (10) years from the date of grant.

The IBAN consists of an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, followed by 2 check digits, and up to 30 alphanumeric characters for the domestic bank account number, called the BBAN (Basic Bank Account Number). Each country's national banking community decides on the fixed length of the BBAN for accounts in that country.
